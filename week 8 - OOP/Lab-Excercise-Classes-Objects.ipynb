    "**Objective:** Understand the implementation of class and instance attributes, and how to manage unique identifiers for each class instance in Python. <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "**Task Description:**\n",
    "> Define a class named **Movie**. <br>\n",
    "> > Within the class, create a class attribute named **id_counter** initialized to 0. This attribute will track the next available ID for new movie instances. <br>\n",
    "> > Define the **_ _init_ _** method to accept **title** and **rating** as parameters. Additionally, the **_ _init_ _** method should automatically set an **id** instance attribute by incrementing **Movie.id_counter** and assign this new value to the **id**.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Ensure that each new **Movie** instance has a unique **id** by incrementing **Movie.id_counter** each time a new instance is created.<br>\n",
    "> Inside the **Movie** class, define a method info that prints out the movie's ID, title, and rating in a readable format.<br>\n",
    "Test your class:<br>\n",
    "> > Create an instance of the **Movie** class with the title \"Inception\" and a rating of 8.8.\n",
    "> > Create another instance of the **Movie** class with the title \"The Matrix\" and a rating of 8.7.\n",
    "> > Call the **info** method on both instances to display their information.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Expected Output:** When calling the **info** method on your **Movie** instances, the output should display the ID, title, and rating of each movie, like so:\n",

    "ID: 1, Title: Inception, Rating: 8.8ID: 2, Title: The Matrix, Rating: 8.7\n",

    "\n",
    "**Guidelines:** <br>\n",
    "> > Remember that the **id_counter** should be incremented only within the _ _init_ _ method.\n",
    "> > Do not forget to use the **self** keyword when working with instance attributes.\n",
    "> > Use the **@classmethod** decorator if you decide to create a class method to increment the **id_counter**.\n",
    "> > Provide comments in your code to explain the purpose of each method and attribute."
